This is a full-stack project built with a C# (.NET Core) backend and a React frontend. The system is designed to manage and display daily weather measurements collected by various measurement stations. On the server side, station information is stored in a SQL database and includes: station number, address, city, and the name of the person in charge. Each station saves a daily JSON file named using the station number and the date (e.g., 101__05.01.2025.json). Each JSON file contains a list of weather measurements for that day, including: time of measurement, temperature, rainfall amount, and wind speed.

The backend is built using ASP.NET Core Web API and connects to a SQL Server database using Entity Framework. It includes business logic that loads station data from the database, reads JSON files from a local directory, processes the data, and returns processed results through RESTful API endpoints. On the frontend, the React app uses Axios to fetch data from the API and displays the list of stations and their daily summaries using tables and charts in a clear and user-friendly way. The interface uses Material UI for styling and is responsive for mobile use.

The project is structured with a clear separation of concerns: DAL (Data Access Layer) for database interaction, BL (Business Logic) for processing, and API as the communication layer with the frontend. The client side includes modular, reusable components. Measurement files are loaded dynamically by station and date. The system can be extended to store measurement data in the database rather than just in files, allow file uploads via the interface, manage user authentication and roles, and support advanced filtering by date, temperature, rainfall, and more.

Technologies used: C# ASP.NET Core, SQL Server, Entity Framework, React, Axios, Material UI, and JSON. This project demonstrates the full development flow from database and file handling to business logic, API exposure, and modern client-side UI â€“ a complete example of an end-to-end system.
